`design thinking`, `OpenScad`, `PrusaSlicer`

# context

For a Masters course, the objective was to design a pedagogical device aimed at improving the user experience FacLab users at the University of Geneva. This has been done using [OpenSCAD](https://openscad.org/) modeling and 3D printing ([Prusa](https://www.prusa3d.com/fr/)). In terms of methodology, [design thinking](https://dschool.stanford.edu/resources/getting-started-with-design-thinking) was our way-to-go, an iterative and collaborative design approach to problem solving.
