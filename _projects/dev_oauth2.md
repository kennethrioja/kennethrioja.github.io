# tools

`TS`, `NestJS`

# context

The last big project at [42 Lausanne](https://42lausanne.ch/) is to do a web project: do a Pong game and users should authenticate through the 42 API. I was in charge on implementing this OAuth2 part in the project. I understood that a server is not only here to store data but it can also give you an authentication token (if you registered to the server) to say that you are an actual person and thus allow other servers to trust this authentication. Thank you Kevin for your patience and for what you taught me!
