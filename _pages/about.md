I am an Instructional Designer by training (Master [MALTT](https://maltt.unige.ch/master/qui-sommes-nous/)) with a proven expertise on data analyses and strong programming skills (C, C++, JS, Python, Unity, see my projects [here](./projects)). In my master's thesis, I employed unsupervised machine learning techniques to cluster users' behaviors playing a game ([Rioja, 2024](http://dx.doi.org/10.13140/RG.2.2.36751.19365/1)).

With five years' experience as a research assistant in a [cognitive neuroscience lab (Brain and Learning Bavelier Lab)](https://www.unige.ch/fapse/brainlearning/), my tasks ranged from data management (design, collect, clean, analyse, communicate), to writing articles (unraveling the link between media multitasking and sustained attention, [Rioja et al., 2023](https://doi.org/10.1037/tmb0000106)), to programming (JS, PHP, Laravel) and launching cognitive tasks in the "cloud" (AWS EC2/S3, Azure).

While working for the Bavelier Lab, I successfully completed the "common core" of the [computer science school 42 Lausanne](https://42lausanne.ch/) where I learned how to program in C and C++, and for the last group project, I was in charge of implementing an [OAuth2 using NestJS](https://github.com/papawou/42_transcendance_backend). The acquired skills allowed me to develop a [RESTful API in Python (Flask)](https://github.com/kennethrioja/flask-restfulapi/) to collect logs from a video game for an EdTech lab ([Laboratoire d'Innovation Pédagogique)](https://www.lip-unige.ch/2024/01/23/en-avant-vers-2024/)).

In the past three years, I [mentored groups of 3-to-5 students on acquiring soft skills](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/kennethrioja_projet-dinnovation-p%C3%A9dagogique-comp%C3%A9tences-activity-7046728449331269632-67lV), [taught courses about R in an interactive manner](https://elearning.unige.ch/formation/) which increased attendants' self-reported digital knowledge by 28.7% and renovated a flat with my girlfriend on weekends.
