`Unity`, `C#`

# context

An individually developed pedagogical video game module for a Masters course (VIP), original idea by [Bei Cai](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bei-cai-959960250/). The main assignment required that learning must be integrated in the principal mechanic of the game. The goal of the game is to teach additions and subtractions to young pupils. The player must count the difference between their stack of bricks and the final stack of bricks, type '+' or '-' with the difference number and validate to be able to move forward.

# pitch

Help the "Lapin Couard" escape the villains hunting him ! The road to freedom is not an easy path, block road bricks are interfering with your way out. Tell to "Lapin Couard" how many bricks he needs to *add* or *remove* under his feet to create a bridge and escape !

# improvements

- What happens when we give a false answer ?
- UI. Music. Definitely.
- What is the final goal of the game ?
