This Masters group project was carried out with Masters colleagues [Bei Cai](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bei-cai-959960250/) and [M√©lina Doguet](https://www.linkedin.com/in/m%C3%A9lina-doguet-742861200/?originalSubdomain=ch), in collaboration with [Bilingo](https://www.bilingo.fr/) who aims at providing "English training (...) to restart learning english lessons with confidence and in a highly interactive manner". The project consisted of several parts, first the design of three potential solutions looking at the project sponsor needs then the development of the chosen solution. The [design of three solutions](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1a2u_MrNl6e1uin4Kh9VHop7V35NpRC2v/edit) was made possible through a [needs analysis](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KOUqkwUH5CQrDo7hdZbSjX2uWstNRqgKmK9jLzP8JIY) that included [semi-structured interviews](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KOUqkwUH5CQrDo7hdZbSjX2uWstNRqgKmK9jLzP8JIY/edit#heading=h.12rr0cg5m1gh) and [personas](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KOUqkwUH5CQrDo7hdZbSjX2uWstNRqgKmK9jLzP8JIY/edit#heading=h.8wjj957rjnz) of the target users. This group work was carried out over one semester for the first part, followed by five weeks for the game development. Each person of the group was involved in the design, the exchanges with Bilingo as well as the final choice, for the second part I was mainly responsible of developing the game.
