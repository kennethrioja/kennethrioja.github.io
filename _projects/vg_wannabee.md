# context

[Wannabee](https://benjamin-vermot.itch.io/wanna-bee) was made in one week-end in November 2023. This game was the first made under the [VeryKoolGames](https://www.instagram.com/verykoolgames/) label, an indie video game studio composed of [Benjamin Vermot](https://benjaminvermot.ch/index.html), [Victor Vermot](https://www.linkedin.com/in/victor-vermot-petit-outhenin-02786b23b/) and I. I was repsonsible of programming the random static position and spawnning of the collectibles and the behavior of the turret flower.

# pitch

In a world where bees and cute little robots, the *wannabees*, live in symbiosis, you must use your ingenuity to heal the Great Divine Trees. Pick up resources, call bees and plant flowers to gather the needed resources and offer them to the Great Divine Tree.
