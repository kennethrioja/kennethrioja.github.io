During the past two months I took graphic design courses using [Affinity](https://affinity.serif.com/en-gb/) Publisher and Designer. When finding arguments to justify paying 100.- to attend this course, I had a global objective in mind: "Be familiar with an *easy-to-use* Mac app to be able to digitally create and design", and more precisely: "Be able to create UI icons or Instagram posts for the next video games made by [Very Kool Games](https://www.instagram.com/verykoolgames/)".

However, we did not have on going projects at this time so I decided to use the recently acquired skills to create a poster for an event I was organising and here is the result:

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"></div>
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        <a href="https://www.instagram.com/wizstreetcomp/" target="_blank">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/blog_gwscposter.jpeg" title="geneva wiz street comp poster" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
        </a>
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"></div>
</div>

Also when creating the instagram page of the event, I wanted something visually appealing when arriving on the page, so I created a personalized grid to display the multiple sponsors of the event:

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"></div>
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        <a href="https://www.instagram.com/wizstreetcomp/">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/blog_gwscgrid.jpeg" title="geneva wiz street comp instagram grid" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
        </a>
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"></div>
</div>

What I want to say here is that, when you engage yourself in a course, hackathon, gamejam or or if you are learning something, find a quick project to apply this knowledge during or right after the event. During the event where you are learning something, focus your time and energy on this specific aim. Ask specific questions to the mentors or teachers who are present. And ultimately, show that you have done it ðŸ˜‰
