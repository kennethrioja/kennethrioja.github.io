`Figma`

# context

During a four-month project base course, teaming up with [Ninn Langel](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ninnlangel/) and [Rima Achour Rahmani](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rima-achour-rahmani-b4b456179/), we were told to create an interactive mockup of a website coming from [Ninn's specification](https://tecfaetu.unige.ch/etu-maltt/concordia/langel1/ergo-1/cahier_des_charges.pdf). A first version of the mockup was improved through user testing which included a five-second test, observation of tasks to be performed, [User Experience Questionnaire](https://www.ueq-online.org/) ([Laugwitz et al., 2008](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221217803_Construction_and_Evaluation_of_a_User_Experience_Questionnaire)), post-test interviews.
