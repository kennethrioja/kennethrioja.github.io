# `#OPENTOWORK`

Hi there üëã I will be free by the end of september 2024. I am currently looking for a one to six month internship in any of these fields : `UX research`, `Learning Analytics`, `Game Development`, `Data Science`.

I am an Educational Technology student having five years of experience in a [cognitive science lab](https://www.unige.ch/fapse/brainlearning/) while [mentoring](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/kennethrioja_projet-dinnovation-p%C3%A9dagogique-comp%C3%A9tences-activity-7046728449331269632-67lV), [teaching](https://elearning.unige.ch/formation/) and [writing my Master's thesis](https://maltt.unige.ch/) at the [University of Geneva](https://unige.ch/). I also completed the common core at [42 Lausanne](https://42lausanne.ch/).

<!-- Accomplished X as by measured Y by doing Z -->
["Focus on data", some might say](https://www.google.com/about/careers/applications/interview-tips/?hl=en_US). Among these experiences, I have increased university students' self-reported digital knowledge by 28.7% in one-day by designing interactive courses, one of them focused on data science using R.

If you are here, it is probably because you are looking for someone with experience in `research`, `ux`, `project management`, `instructional design`, `cognitive psychology`, `coding` or `data analysis`. I would be delighted to discuss with you [by email](mailto:kennethrioja@protonmail.com) so that we can talk about your projects! ([more about me](https://kennethrioja.github.io/blog/2023/university-between-bachelor-and-master/))

I seek to team up with inclusive, talented, creative, innovative and inspiring people aiming for positive contribution to society through digital technologies.<br>
I am very much looking forward to talking with you in person !<br>
Cheers ! ‚òÄÔ∏è
