# `#OPENTOWORK`

Hey üëã I am currently looking for an internship (one to six months) in areas of UX research, Learning Analytics, UI / Game Development, Data Science to begin a career in one of the stated fields in Geneva. See below how I can cover each one of these topics or [contact me](#contact) !

# here is my story ...

## `research`

I spent five years as a [research assistant at the Brain And Learning Bavelier Lab](https://www.unige.ch/fapse/brainlearning/research/) where I designed scientific experiments in cognitive psychology as well as extracting and analyzing data. I also had the opportunity to [publish scientific articles in peer-reviewed journals](https://kennethrioja.github.io/publications) collaborating with international renowned researchers. With this first enriching professional experience, I knew I wanted to create online tools for making people's life easier or analyze data in an easy way while keeping myself on the programming side. This is why I chose to pursue a [Master in Learning and Teaching Technologies](https://maltt.unige.ch/). This lead to a [Masters thesis focusing on learning analytics](#) where I analyzed data from a museum video game (an 'epistemic' video game to be more precise, aka. 'serious' video game but I don't like to use this term for [several reasons](#contact)).<br>
*Rigor*, *critical thinking* and *determination* are the skills I can extract from these experiences.

## `UX & project management`

The latter curriculum allowed me to engage in real-life projects collaborating with third-parties such as [Bilingo](#projects/bilingo) and the [UNIGE FacLab](#projects/unige-faclab). I followed [user-centered design](https://www.editions-eyrolles.com/Livre/9782212141436/methodes-de-design-ux) and [design thinking](https://dschool.stanford.edu/resources/getting-started-with-design-thinking) approaches. The tools and methods used were: figma, semi-structured interviews (e.g., storytelling), customer analysis, user analysis (e.g., personas, experience maps), competitive analysis, card sorting (e.g., similarity matrices, dendrogram). I also developed my entrepreneurial mindset during the [Business Concept Training run by EPFL Innovation Park](https://www.science2market.ch/). I teamed up with two other colleagues on a house retrofit project, for instance, we interviewed more than thirty users in one week and tackled other challenges a startup can offer.<br>
*Listening to users and customers* about their *problems* and analyzing their *needs* in order to *find solutions* or to *enhance an aspect of a product* is something I know I can help with in my future career.

## `project-based learning & soft skills`

I also experienced other aspects to projects during my Masters curriculum. First, as a student at the [Computer Science School, 42 Lausanne](https://www.42lausanne.ch/), I experienced an immersive project-based learning curriculum ‚Äì no teachers, no courses, no schedule ([how does it work ?](#contact)). Furthermore, I was hired as a [facilitator for a project-based course "Comprendre le Num√©rique"](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7046450909467336704/) at the University of Geneva during two consecutive years. During one semester, the goal was to guide students on a concrete project allowing them to develop their soft skills such as teamwork, problem solving, communication, organization, critical thinking and communication. I was also given the opportunity to [tutor on R and Prolific/Qualtrics](https://www.unige.ch/numerique/take-over), this kind of crash courses were given by students and for students.<br>
*Adaptive*, *fast-learner* and *multitasking* are the skills reflecting this paragraph right ?

## `software development & data analysis`

Thanks to the 42 School, I am confident in writing `C` and `C++` code, in particular and among other projects, I wrote a sorting algorithm (insertion-sort), a shell and an IRC server. `Virtual Machines` and `Docker` were other projects at the school. In my spare time, I enjoy attending Game Jams with friends to create video games using `Unity` and `C#` ([link](#)). At the lab, I was told to create online tasks such as the [TOVA](https://gitlab.unige.ch/brainandlearning/tova) while using a `JavaScript` framework [jspsych](https://www.jspsych.org/7.3/). In another project at the lab, I needed to [visualize and analyze data](https://tmb.apaopen.org/pub/tmb0000106#s23) comparing three different groups using `R` and its statistical tools such as type-I ANOVA, correlations, t-tests (extreme group comparison). About visualization, I dig into `visual network analysis` and [wrote an extended explanation](https://edutechwiki.unige.ch/fr/Analyse_de_r%C3%A9seaux_avec_R) and [a shorter blog post about it](https://methodo-eiah.unige.ch/?p=643). This was the mounting point of my Masters thesis where I used the same technique to tackle [complexity understanding](#).<br>
Not only I feel like I have acquired a bunch of soft skills, but the usage and comprehension on the technical side are allowing me to be confident in *bringing together teams of designers/researchers and software engineers* ([I have been involved in such a project at the lab](#contact)).
