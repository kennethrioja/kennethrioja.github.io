I was introduced to this EPFL course through the [Unitec, "Valorisation de la recherche" course](https://www.unige.ch/unitec/fr/actualite/conference/). Coming from psychology, educational technologies, and working as a lab assistant during four years, the option of pursuing an academic career was THE option. However, I wanted to create more than to do fundamental research. What were the options offered after finishing a [Master in Learning and Teaching Technologies](https://maltt.unige.ch)? What about creating a start-up that would go beyond the limitations often taught in the field? A lot of good ideas were stemming from the fruitful discussions between students, assistants and teachers but most of them, unfortunately, are now remaining in limbo or are totally forgotten. I think it's a shame.

I also think that students, at their early stages in the University, should be introduced to what it is to create a start-up. At least, they should be introduced to knowing the actors and the economic processes underlying a *capitalist* world. One observation I have made is that 90% of the people attending the start-up events at the university of Geneva are PhD students or Post-Docs. 

When I began the first courses in September 2023, it was very disturbing for me. I felt like I was not in the right place. When you are willing to create your own start-up, for sure you must be confident and believe in yourself otherwise people might not trust your ideas and vision. Then, I found out that most of this was a facade and the people were, like me, attending the practical course to learn.

Being impressed by this new environment, I did not suggest any start-up idea (and this was a shame too ha!). Despite my lack of idea, I joined the development of Rebuild.easy. This start-up aims at providing an online platform helping house owners who want to renovate their real estate by offering them a one-stop-shop and no upfront cost. I teamed up with two great people : [Jean Ventura](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jean-ventura-6bba8150/) the founder and [Steven Schramiak](https://www.linkedin.com/in/steven-schramiak-2005/) the business mastermind. The project attracted me first because of the energy and friendly aura from Jean, and second because house renovation was my week-end activity during the last two years.

Here is what I learned during the entire semester ([here](https://github.com/kennethrioja/secondbrain/blob/main/talks.md#11122023--unige-innosuisse-business-training-concept) for more tips):

1. I discovered the small Swiss startup ecosystem and few of their actors (for example, [FONGIT](https://www.linkedin.com/company/fongit/), [VentureLab](https://www.linkedin.com/company/venturelab/), [GENILEM](https://www.linkedin.com/company/genilem/), [Unitec](https://www.unige.ch/unitec/fr/)). I now know the network if someday I want to create my own start-up.

2. I got introduced to finance, law and economics. "Cash is king", they say.

3. Market research is the core pilar of your start-up ‚Äì like UX for a product. Find the needs!

When I now hear start-up, I see either people passionate about their work and trying to solve a current problem, either people who are grabbing opportunities that the current world is offering. What about you?
