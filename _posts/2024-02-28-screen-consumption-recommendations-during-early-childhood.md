I am getting surrounded by more and more young parents and if I were to provide them with scientific-based recommendations in two minutes, I would redirect them to [Edouard Gentaz](https://www.unige.ch/fapse/sensori-moteur/membres/eg)' recommendations:

1. Limit screen consumption as best as you can before two years old.
2. No screen during meals (to limit or avoid [technoference](https://www.academia.edu/15735501/_Technoference_Everyday_Intrusions_and_Interruptions_of_Technology_in_Couple_and_Family_Relationships), also applicable to your couple life!)
3. No screen during waking-up in the morning.
4. Avoid alone and passive consumption for the child.
5. Control the quality of what's been consumed.

Edouard Gentaz is a professor at the faculty of Psychology of the University of Geneva. The above points come from a public seminar I highly enjoyed and I encourage you to [watch the whole talk on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kXtX3C9SchE)!

If you are interested in the topic of screens and children / adolescents, the [Centre Jean Piaget](https://www.unige.ch/centre-piaget/activites-scientifiques/seminaire-piaget/2024) ([FPSE, University of Geneva](https://www.unige.ch/fapse/)) is currently offering public seminars, every Wednesday at 18:15 in room M1170 at [Unimail](https://www.google.fr/maps/place/Uni+Mail,+Bd+du+Pont-d'Arve+40,+1205+Gen%C3%A8ve/@46.1949191,6.1372961,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x478c7ad59a95c06f:0x405b734617bdd72c!8m2!3d46.1949154!4d6.139871!16s%2Fg%2F1tdyppds?entry=ttu).
