# context

[Metano√Øa](https://benjamin-vermot.itch.io/metanoia) was made at the [Epic Game Jam](https://epicgamejam.com/) in August 2023, in collaboration with [Quentin Brechb√ºhl](https://www.linkedin.com/in/qntbre/), L√©o Gaillard, [Benjamin Vermot](https://benjaminvermot.ch/index.html) and [Victor Vermot](https://www.linkedin.com/in/victor-vermot-petit-outhenin-02786b23b/). I was responsible of the random static position and spawn of the environment elements of the map.

# pitch

While camping in the middle of the forest, you hear a scary noise and the wind extinguishes your fire. Quick, grab your rifle ! Wait, is that a tree moving towards you ?  Use your mouse to rotate your torchlight and try to find and shoot at the enemy disguised as an element of the scene.

# improvements

- Include an enemy detection with light effects (e.g., sparkles) on 90% dark screen.
- I personally wanted to add a "Paper Mario" effect for the main character when rotating left or right
