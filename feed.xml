The event was hosted in Ne√ªchatel at the campus Arc 2 de la HE-Arc by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexander-wohlfahrt/">Alexander Wohlfahrt</a>. The goal of the game jam was to create a video game in forty-two hours under the theme ‚Äòconfined‚Äô and publish it on <a href="https://itch.io/">itch.io</a>.</p> <blockquote> <p>‚Äú<em>Incroyable, la qualit√© des enigmes, c‚Äôest insane. Et tr√®s beau design. Bravo!</em>‚Äù ‚Äì comment by <a href="https://itch.io/profile/krucksy">Krucksy</a> on <a href="https://kennethrioja.itch.io/astralchamber">itch.io</a>.</p> </blockquote> <p>üéÆ <a href="https://kennethrioja.itch.io/astralchamber">Play our game here</a>, then read how the entire process went during the jam.</p> <p>It was challenging to make a game out of a well-known and somewhat negatively connotated word: ‚Äú<em>confined</em>‚Äù. Because it was not our first game jam together, we discussed prior the event on the improvement of our workflow. Indeed, we felt we were moving way too fast to the coding and designing aspects before even having a strong core, story or level design. We were also interested in making a game using a cube to be able to use the 3D engine of Unity.</p> <p>This is what we did in the first hours of the game jam : <strong>to set a strong common ground</strong>. Being crystal clear about what our game is, what is its genre, what is the story and what is the primary mechanic. It is also important that we, as active members and part of the group, are being assigned tasks that would drive us and fit our individual growth needs. We then built the story behind the game mechanic to make the theme fit : our main character is ‚Äúconfined‚Äù in a cube and the player must solve puzzles to set him free.</p> <p>Right. We know the time runs amazingly fast in a game jam and we must <strong>set our limits</strong>. How many puzzles then ? How do we share the tasks between us ? What are the deadlines ? Alexander gave us an advice on the Discord channel with the <strong>MoSCoW</strong> method : Must do, Should do, Could do, Won‚Äôt do. We then did our classical brainstorming, during ten minutes, writing as much puzzle ideas as possible, then present them to the team without being interrupted. We then discussed the ideas and tried to fusion some of the ideas together if we saw complementarity. Finally, we chose four puzzles to dispatch along the six faces of our cube. During this phase, I had a clear idea and the programming logic for the current third face, which was challenged by Victor. I had to defend my idea by demonstrating step-by-step how I would make the puzzle work. I liked how Victor naturally took the role of a devil‚Äôs advocate because it obliged me to be clear on my proof demostration.</p> <p>Since we already knew each other, tasks-sharing was based on our field of expertise. Our lead graphic designer, Ben, was creating all the visual assets. Victor and I shared the programming of the puzzles, I was mainly on the three first faces and Victor did the three last faces. When I wanted to do something else, I wrote the story and we also found the music and audio effects together with Victor.</p> <p>This game allowed me to be more familiar with animations. Moreover, group-wise, we were genuinely satisfated by how we planned our tasks because at the end we had a solid gameplay core with four challenging puzzles. Our game was playable from the begining until the end at the end of the jam ‚Äì let me remind you we did it in only forty-two hours !</p> <p>Also this game was the first for us to win a second place ü•à in a competition ! We are grateful for everyone‚Äôs feedbacks and positive evaluations, it makes us want to move forward and continue what we began together !</p> <p>If you haven‚Äôt done it yet, please follow our <a href="https://www.instagram.com/verykoolgames/">Instagram account @VeryKoolGames</a> and we would be delighted to have a friendly comment or a DM if you liked our game !</p> <hr/> <p>A take-home message if you want to do a game jam :</p> <ol> <li><em>Set a common ground where everyone is aligned on the group direction and where you can meet one of your need</em>. For example, brainstorm on the game ideas and direction then decide what you will do by explicitely communicating to the group one of your personal goal / need : ‚ÄúI would like to do (task assigned) because I can (personal acquired skill) and I want to develop (personal growth need).‚Äù</li> <li><em>Set your limits</em>. By limits, I mean in terms of your skills and the time available. Before going to the jam, be clear about yourself and what you can offer to a group. Overselling your self here is not necessary if you cannot do what you said you can do. And once the game idea is commonly accepted, set strict deadlines.</li> </ol>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="hobby"/><category term="code"/><category term="videogames"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Do you like escape games?]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Using mutate with multiple conditions including grepl in R</title><link href="https://kennethrioja.github.io/blog/2024/using-mutate-with-multiple-conditions-including-grepl-in-r/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Using mutate with multiple conditions including grepl in R"/><published>2024-03-15T13:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-03-15T13:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://kennethrioja.github.io/blog/2024/using-mutate-with-multiple-conditions-including-grepl-in-r</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://kennethrioja.github.io/blog/2024/using-mutate-with-multiple-conditions-including-grepl-in-r/"><![CDATA[<p>In my case, I had one <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">id</code> containing two games/sessions, as shown by different dates in my column <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">timeStamp</code> which is of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">char</code> data type in the raw data.</p> <p>The example below shows how I differenciated the two IDs.

The pitch: two days in <a href="https://www.zhaw.ch/fr/universite/">ZHAW</a>, use Design Thinking to ideate on future learning spaces.</p> <p>After applicating to the call, I got selected to be part of this adventure! Thank you <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/lisa-messenzehl-5b777b19a/">Lisa</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tereza-karag%C3%BClle-405503b2/">Tereza</a> and <a href="https://www.switch.ch/">Switch</a> for the opportunity!</p> <p>First day, on February 7, we attended a key note by <a href="https://www.james858499.net/">James Lamb</a> about post digital learning spaces of higher education (<a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s42438-021-00279-9">Lamb et al., 2021</a>). A learning space is any setting where learning and teaching activities take place. Also a learning space is heavily contingent on the context, so this is why he gave us not tips, but ways on how to build the best learning space. He made a list of six points :</p> <ol> <li><em>An online space is always also a physical space</em>. As he mentionned <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s42438-021-00265-1">Gourlay (2021)</a>, there are no ‚Äòvirtual learning‚Äô, the learning is always a true experience.</li> <li><em>Create space for imagination</em>. He emphasized that digital technology must be seen as a ressource (active in the process) and not as a passive tool.</li> <li><em>Innovation without exclusion</em>. ‚ÄúAll students like this‚Äù, well‚Ä¶ maybe not! James mentionned that we should be able to achieve through mixed reality what cannot be achieved in physical or online (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/14626268.2018.1511601">Flint et al., 2018</a>).</li> <li><em>Attend to the aesthetics, emotional &amp; sensory elements of a learning space</em>. This point resonated in me. Aesthetics matter indeed, but we are often not taught much about the importance of aesthetics. ‚ÄúIt is of first importance to make a learning space work in a mechanical way, the aesthetics come after‚Äù, this is what I often hear unfortunately. Only few passionate students are able to create something at the same level of design and aesthetic than most of the new tech companies.</li> <li><em>Pursue pleasure and make room for play</em>. There should be a link between formal and informal learning spaces (<a href="https://brill.com/downloadpdf/book/9789460916090/BP000005.pdf">Boys, 2011</a>) and the environment should be pleasant (e.g., plants, color, light, music).</li> <li><em>Every learning space should be assigned in harmony with our natural world</em>. We must ‚Äúreimagine sustainable forms of education technology‚Äù (<a href="https://www.academia.edu/download/98619725/Unesco_Background_Ed_Tech.pdf">Facer &amp; Selwyn, 2021</a>)</li> </ol> <p>Then came one full day of Design Thinking. I teamed up with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/davide-ghielmetti-033732a5/">Davide</a> from economics, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/isabella-loder-21419b21b/">Isabella</a> from health promotion and prevention and Sara from education. It was a rich experience to work with students from different backgrounds, which is not an opportunity often given at the university! Also I found challenging to create and pitch our idea in less than eight hours of work. I applause the time management from our coach <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/martinarechsteiner/">Martina</a>!</p> <p>Moreover, when talking with peers of my Master curriculum, we felt like we have not learned anything new in terms of digital technologies from this design thinking workshop. I personnally think that most of the limitations and implications of what it is to have the ideal learning setup (online, physical, synchronous, asynchronous, etc.) was already taught and discussed in class (see <a href="https://edutechwiki.unige.ch/fr/ADID">ADID EduTechWiki page</a> for more information).</p> <p>From all the ideas of what could be a future learning space, words like ‚Äúpersonalisation‚Äù, ‚Äústudents‚Äô needs‚Äù, ‚Äúgoal‚Äù were repeatedly used.</p> <p>Link to the promotional video of the event: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWy5iNByxQ4</p> <p>Link to another blog post (en fran√ßais) in the CIEL blog of the UNIGE where I share my experience:</p> <hr/> <p>What I will keep in mind after these two days :</p> <ol> <li>Aesthetics matter in digital technologies.

This experience sets the base for minimum skills, both human and technical. (‚Ä¶) [it] lets students learn C programming, develop simple software using classic algorithms, discover access to the file system, and learn management of the UNIX process. It also includes a simple first approach to network architecture as well as system administration. The program also offers oriented programming and a client-server project‚Äù</em> ‚Äì <a href="https://42.fr/en/the-program/software-engineer-degree/">42</a></p> <p>A computer school with no courses, no hours, no teachers and tuition-free. That was the promise made and kept by <a href="https://42lausanne.ch/">42 Lausanne</a>! The beginning of my coding journey started when I began using <a href="https://www.r-project.org/">R</a> during my full-time research assistant position at the <a href="https://www.unige.ch/fapse/brainlearning/">Bavelierlab</a>. For me, it was sort of coding and I loved it. Being able to automatize through scripts was a timesaver for me! My lab director pushed me to look for computer science schools. Fortunately for me, 42 was opening a new campus in Lausanne! I gave it a shot and I was not disappointed.</p> <p>After two years and a half (August 2021 ‚Äì January 2024) at 42, I am now taking a step back and this is what I see :</p> <p><em>Step 1: The ‚ÄòPiscine‚Äô.</em> I spent the best one month of peer-learning how to code in C.</p> <p><em>Step 2: Finding the right balance.</em> During the first year, it was a real challenge to make 42 Lausanne, my <a href="https://maltt.unige.ch/master/qui-sommes-nous/">Master</a> and the part-time job at the lab work together. I successfully handled it and the first year was a total bliss. How satisfying it was to get the work done and to know more and more computer science concepts!</p> <p><em>Step 3: Loneliness.</em> At the beginning of the second year, it began harder to find people progressing at the same pace. I began to work almost on my own and let me tell you this is not how the school experience (and learning in general) should be. <a href="https://doi.org/10.3102/00346543071003449">You always learn best when confronting your ideas to other people (Lou et al., 2001)</a>.</p> <p><em>Step 4: Disillusion.</em> Towards the end of the second year, I was always finishing my projects at less than five days of being kicked out the school. I remember hard moments at the edge of the Black Hole (name given to the day-counter of the school). Completing the 42 curriculum, for what? I will be forever thankful to my girlfriend who relentlessly supported me, making me stop my endless questionning of the purpose of completing 42.</p> <p><em>Step 5: Freedom.</em> On the 22nd of December, I finished the last project of the common core <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">transcendence</code> and on the 20th of January I passed my last exam. Finally !!! üéâ The last comment made at the last evaluation for the project was: <em>‚ÄúMention: D√©gage de mon common core‚Äù</em>, sure I will!</p> <p>A note for the educational researchers out there! I find clever the whole 42 organization : ‚Äúcome as you are‚Äù, no discrimination, no prerequisites, no hierarchical pressure, only you come and learn because you want it. <em>Autonomy</em>. Then nudging the people to meet new colleagues by enforcing peer-evaluation and group work. The more you evaluate, the more you know people, the more you connect with the people you enjoy being with. <em>Relatedness</em>. Engaging the people in the whole process, making them acquiring new skills, then introduce them to the people who fund the institution. <em>Competence</em>. Yes, this is how you create self-determination in students (<a href="https://selfdeterminationtheory.org/SDT/documents/2000_RyanDeci_SDT.pdf">Deci &amp; Ryan, 1985</a>)</p> <hr/> <p>For you, the IT or code newbie, it is up to you to engage in such a process but here are my arguments on why you should join 42 Lausanne:</p> <ol> <li>I met like-minded people who are now close friends (SO <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/victor-vermot-petit-outhenin-02786b23b/">Victor</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/romainhoarau/">Romain</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/joseph-e/">Yossi</a>). And to say the truth, I was not expecting this AT ALL nor tried to make new friends at the begining!</li> <li>Acquiring these global tech knowledge and skills opened me to new opportunities. I began following my dream, developping video games and sharing this dream with people I met in 42. I was given other tasks at the lab, interpreting researchers needs for a web developper to build an experiment management system. And finally I felt confident in accepting an internship at the <a href="https://www.lip-unige.ch/2024/01/23/en-avant-vers-2024/">LIP</a> which consists in developping a REST API to collect logs from an educational video game made with Unity.</li> <li>New opportunities can never finish with the multiple events made at 42 Lausanne, most of the time inviting start-ups, partners and tech companies!</li> <li>Be courageous and be sure to count on your loved ones if you are currently engaged in multiple activities / jobs / hobbies.</li> </ol>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="work"/><category term="code"/><category term="misc"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[My learnings after two years at 42 Lausanne]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">What comes to mind if you read ‚ÄúStart-up‚Äù?</title><link href="https://kennethrioja.github.io/blog/2023/innosuisse-business-training-concept/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="What comes to mind if you read ‚ÄúStart-up‚Äù?"/><published>2023-12-11T12:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2023-12-11T12:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://kennethrioja.github.io/blog/2023/innosuisse-business-training-concept</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://kennethrioja.github.io/blog/2023/innosuisse-business-training-concept/"><![CDATA[<div class="row"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="/assets/img/blog_ibct2023-480.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="/assets/img/blog_ibct2023-800.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 1400px)" srcset="/assets/img/blog_ibct2023-1400.webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/blog_ibct2023.jpeg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" title="a class group" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> Finding Kenneth üîç </div> <p>I was introduced to this EPFL course through the <a href="https://www.unige.ch/unitec/fr/actualite/conference/">Unitec, ‚ÄúValorisation de la recherche‚Äù course</a>. Coming from psychology, educational technologies, and working as a lab assistant during four years, the option of pursuing an academic career was THE option. However, I wanted to create more than to do fundamental research. What were the options offered after finishing a <a href="https://maltt.unige.ch">Master in Learning and Teaching Technologies</a>? What about creating a start-up that would go beyond the limitations often taught in the field? A lot of good ideas were stemming from the fruitful discussions between students, assistants and teachers but most of them, unfortunately, are now remaining in limbo or are totally forgotten. I think it‚Äôs a shame.</p> <p>I also think that students, at their early stages in the University, should be introduced to what it is to create a start-up. At least, they should be introduced to knowing the actors and the economic processes underlying a <em>capitalist</em> world. One observation I have made is that 90% of the people attending the start-up events at the university of Geneva are PhD students or Post-Docs.</p> <p>When I began the first courses in September 2023, it was very disturbing for me. I felt like I was not in the right place. When you are willing to create your own start-up, for sure you must be confident and believe in yourself otherwise people might not trust your ideas and vision. Then, I found out that most of this was a facade and the people were, like me, attending the practical course to learn.</p> <p>Being impressed by this new environment, I did not suggest any start-up idea (and this was a shame too ha!). Despite my lack of idea, I joined the development of Rebuild.easy. This start-up aims at providing an online platform helping house owners who want to renovate their real estate by offering them a one-stop-shop and no upfront cost. I teamed up with two great people : <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jean-ventura-6bba8150/">Jean Ventura</a> the founder and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/steven-schramiak-2005/">Steven Schramiak</a> the business mastermind. The project attracted me first because of the energy and friendly aura from Jean, and second because house renovation was my week-end activity during the last two years.</p> <hr/> <p>Here is what I learned during the entire semester (<a href="https://github.com/kennethrioja/secondbrain/blob/main/talks.md#11122023--unige-innosuisse-business-training-concept">here</a> for more tips):</p> <ol> <li> <p>I discovered the small Swiss startup ecosystem and few of their actors (for example, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/fongit/">FONGIT</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/venturelab/">VentureLab</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/genilem/">GENILEM</a>, <a href="https://www.unige.ch/unitec/fr/">Unitec</a>). I now know the network if someday I want to create my own start-up.</p> </li> <li> <p>I got introduced to finance, law and economics. ‚ÄúCash is king‚Äù, they say.</p> </li> <li> <p>Market research is the core pilar of your start-up ‚Äì like UX for a product. Find the needs!</p> </li> </ol> <p>When I now hear start-up, I see either people passionate about their work and trying to solve a current problem, either people who are grabbing opportunities that the current world is offering.
