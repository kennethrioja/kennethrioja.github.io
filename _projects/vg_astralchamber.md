[Astral Chamber](https://kennethrioja.itch.io/astralchamber) was made at the [UPsi Jam 4.0](https://itch.io/jam/upsi-jam-4-0) in Neuch√¢tel, Switzerland, in March 2024, under the [VeryKoolGames](https://www.instagram.com/verykoolgames/) label, an indie video game studio composed of [Benjamin Vermot](https://benjaminvermot.ch/index.html), [Victor Vermot](https://www.linkedin.com/in/victor-vermot-petit-outhenin-02786b23b/) and I. I was responsible of programming the mechanics of the first three faces and the animation of the character.

# pitch

> Incroyable, la qualit√© des enigmes, c'est insane. Et tr√®s beau design. Bravo! ‚Äì comment by [Krucksy](https://itch.io/profile/krucksy) on [itch.io](https://kennethrioja.itch.io/astralchamber).

Confined in a cube for decades, loneliness is doom. You have found a strange cube in the attic of your grand-parents. You have touched it and now you are propelled in an astral world where you have been given omniscient power to save a small character.
