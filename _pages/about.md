I am an Instructional Designer by training with a proven expertise on data analyses, e.g., clustering behaviors in a game ([Rioja, 2024](http://dx.doi.org/10.13140/RG.2.2.36751.19365/1)), comparing the outcomes of two versions of a questionnaire ([Rioja, 2023](https://doi.org/10.1037/tmb0000106)).

My major professional experience was to do research during five years in a [cognitive science lab (Brain and Learning Lab)](https://www.unige.ch/fapse/brainlearning/) where I was given many tasks such as collecting and analyzing data which led to publishing my first 'first-author' article before graduating.

While working for the Brain and Learning Lab, I enrolled and successfully completed the 'common core' of the [computer science school 42 Lausanne](https://42lausanne.ch/). The newly acquired skills allowed me to be in charge of the maintenance of a Laravel/PHP web platform for managing online studies at the lab and to develop a [RESTful API to collect logs from a video game](https://github.com/kennethrioja/flask-restfulapi/) in another [EdTech lab (Laboratoire d'Innovation Pédagogique)](https://www.lip-unige.ch/2024/01/23/en-avant-vers-2024/).

In the last three years, I was also [mentoring for two years in a row two distinct groups of 3-to-5 students on acquiring soft skills](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/kennethrioja_projet-dinnovation-p%C3%A9dagogique-comp%C3%A9tences-activity-7046728449331269632-67lV), [teaching in interactive courses about R](https://elearning.unige.ch/formation/) which increased attendants' self-reported digital knowledge by 28.7%, and [writing my master's thesis](http://dx.doi.org/10.13140/RG.2.2.36751.19365/1) in [Science in Learning and Teaching Technologies](https://maltt.unige.ch/) at the [University of Geneva](https://unige.ch/).
