# context

"Play and Learning", that was the title of the master's thesis project proposed by my director [Eric Sanchez](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sanchezeric/). He told me he got quantitative data about the game [AL2049](https://www.alimentarium.org/fr/activities/al2049-lescape-game-de-lalimentarium) ([Digital Kingdom](https://digitalkingdom.ch/projet/al-2049/)) played in a museum nearby. I was excited to find quantitative indicators of complexity, and more particularly, how players can tackle non-linearity as exposed by the game design. Data analyses led me to clustering players behaviors in a timely fashion (time-series analyses).
