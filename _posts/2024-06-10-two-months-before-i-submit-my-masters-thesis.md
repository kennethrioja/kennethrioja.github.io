Now that the Master's thesis is soon to be finished, people ask me : "What's next?"

What I am sure is that video games are now a part of my professional identity and core interests.

Having worked 5 years as a research assistant at Brain and Learning Lab on hwo action video games can foster learning and other cognitive abilities. 

I recently became a member of the Swiss Game Developer Association, having participated to the annual General Meeting to meet folks from the Swiss scene and where I want to imply myself more.

In two months I will defend my Master's thesis on the analysis of play data from a museum's video game.

I will still continue creating entertainment games with the Vermot bros under the VeryKoolGames label.

We have some very passionate discussions with Ivan and Helene about the profound essence of games and there might be something flourishing from our great discussions someday!
