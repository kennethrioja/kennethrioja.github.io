`R`

# context

One of the challenges during COVID at the Brain And Learning lab was that we wanted to test whether collecting data through online platforms was possible or not. This led to this online project where I needed to collect data from three different platforms (MTurk, Prolific and remotely in another university). I set up Qualtrics, Prolific and MTurk to make this happen. Then after collecting data, I analyzed most of the data in collaboration with [Sezen Cekic](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Sezen-Cekic). On my side, I ran type-I ANOVAs, correlations, extreme group analyses.
