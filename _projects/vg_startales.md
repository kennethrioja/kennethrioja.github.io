# context

Star Tales was made at the [Swiss Game Academy](https://gameacademy.ch/SGA/) in August 2022, in collaboration with [Nadia Chennaf](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nadiachennaf/?originalSubdomain=ch), [Tiago Pinto Monteiro](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tiagopintomonteiro/), [Benjamin Vermot](https://benjaminvermot.ch/index.html) and [Victor Vermot](https://www.linkedin.com/in/victor-vermot-petit-outhenin-02786b23b/) . I was responsible of writing the story behind the words and making the word lighten up for correct letters.

# pitch

StarTales is an adorable typing game in which you guide a cute little wizard armed with their devastating star-eating wand. Using your favorite keyboard, type the letters found within these stars as they try to escape your sight. Get your fingers ready, and type away!
