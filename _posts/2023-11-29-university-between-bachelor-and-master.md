# A bit of context

I finished my Bachelor of Psychology in June 2019 and while writing this blog post I am soon to finish my Masters of Learning and Teaching Technologies, hopefully in summer 2024 ðŸ¤ž. "5 years !" you must say, hold on and see what I have done. *Spoiler alert* : I did not spend a year under the palm trees.

# Research

I spent five years as a <a ref="https://www.unige.ch/fapse/brainlearning/">research assistant at the Brain And Learning Bavelier Lab</a> where I designed scientific experiments in cognitive psychology as well as extracting and analyzing data. I also had the opportunity to [publish scientific articles in peer-reviewed journals](https://kennethrioja.github.io/projects/#publications) collaborating with international renowned researchers. With this first enriching professional experience, I knew I wanted to create online tools for making people's life easier or analyze data in an easy way while keeping myself on the programming side. That is why I chose to pursue a [Master in Learning and Teaching Technologies](https://maltt.unige.ch/) ([link to my Masters Projects page](https://edutechwiki.unige.ch/fmediawiki/index.php?title=Utilisateur:Kenneth_Rioja)). This will lead to a Masters thesis focusing on learning analytics where I am currently analyzing data from a museum video game (an 'epistemic' video game to be more precise, aka. 'serious' video game but this term is inaccurate for [several reasons](https://kennethrioja.github.io/)).<br>
*Rigor*, *critical thinking* and *determination* are the skills I can extract from these experiences.

# UX & project management

The latter curriculum allowed me to engage in real-life projects collaborating with third-parties such as [Bilingo](https://kennethrioja.github.io/projects/vg_findher) and the [UNIGE FacLab](https://kennethrioja.github.io/projects/ux_unigefaclab). I followed [user-centered design](https://www.editions-eyrolles.com/Livre/9782212141436/methodes-de-design-ux) and [design thinking](https://dschool.stanford.edu/resources/getting-started-with-design-thinking) approaches. Tools and methods used were: figma, semi-structured interviews (e.g., storytelling), customer analysis, user analysis (e.g., personas, experience maps), competitive analysis, card sorting (e.g., similarity matrices, dendrogram). I also developed my entrepreneurial mindset during the [Business Concept Training run by EPFL Innovation Park](https://www.science2market.ch/) where I teamed up with two other colleagues on a house retrofit project. One of the main approach to the project development was to conduct more than 30 interviews to have a clear customer segmentation for instance.<br>
*Listening to users and customers* about their *problems* and analyzing their *needs* in order to *find solutions* or to *enhance an aspect of a product* is something I know I can help with in my future career.

# Project-based learning & soft skills

I also experienced other aspects to projects during my Masters curriculum. First, as a student at the [Computer Science School, 42 Lausanne](https://www.42lausanne.ch/), I experienced an immersive project-based learning curriculum â€“ no teachers, no courses, no schedule ([how does it work ?](https://kennethrioja.github.io/)). Furthermore, I was hired as a [facilitator for a project-based course "Comprendre le NumÃ©rique"](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7046450909467336704/) at the University of Geneva during two consecutive years. The goal was to guide students on a concrete project allowing them to develop their soft skills such as teamwork, problem solving, communication, organization, critical thinking and communication. I was also given the opportunity to [tutor on R and Prolific/Qualtrics](https://www.unige.ch/numerique/take-over), these crash courses were given by students and for students.<br>
These experiences allowed me to be *adaptive*, to *learn fast* and to effectively *switch between tasks*.

# Software development & data analysis

Thanks to the 42 School, I am confident in using `C` and `C++` languages, in particular and among other projects, I wrote a sorting algorithm (insertion-sort), a shell and an IRC server. Setting up `virtual machines` and a `Docker` *manually* were other projects at the school. In my spare time, I enjoy attending Game Jams with friends to create video games using `Unity` and `C#` ([link](https://kennethrioja.github.io/projects)). At the lab, I was told to create online tasks such as the [TOVA](https://kennethrioja.github.io/projects/misc_tova) while using a `JavaScript` framework [jspsych](https://www.jspsych.org/7.3/). In another project at the lab, I needed to [visualize and analyze data](https://kennethrioja.github.io/projects/da_ranalyses) using `R` and its statistical tools such as type-I ANOVA, correlations, t-tests (extreme group comparison). About visualization, I also dig into `visual network analysis` and [wrote an extended explanation and a shorter blog post about it](https://kennethrioja.github.io/projects/da_vnaintro). This was the starting point of my Masters thesis where I used the same technique to tackle [complexity understanding](https://kennethrioja.github.io/projects/da_mastersthesis).<br>
Acquiring hard skills is enriching, but using soft skills to *bring together teams of designers/researchers and web developers/software engineers* to advance on a project is more powerful ([I have been involved in such a project at the lab](https://kennethrioja.github.io/)).

# What's coming next

I am now writing my Masters thesis and continuing my journey as a master student. More projects are coming: finishing the common core at the 42 school in Lausanne, the start-up I am helping with, another semester to mentor a group of student for the course "Comprendre le NumÃ©rique" and continuing my job as a researcher. 

And I am still looking for an internship, so please [contact me ðŸŽ‰](https://kennethrioja.github.io/) !
