I also had the opportunity to <a href="https://kennethrioja.github.io/projects/#publications">publish scientific articles in peer-reviewed journals</a> collaborating with international renowned researchers. With this first enriching professional experience, I knew I wanted to create online tools for making people‚Äôs life easier or analyze data in an easy way while keeping myself on the programming side. That is why I chose to pursue a <a href="https://maltt.unige.ch/">Master in Learning and Teaching Technologies</a> (<a href="https://edutechwiki.unige.ch/fmediawiki/index.php?title=Utilisateur:Kenneth_Rioja">link to my Masters Projects page</a>). This will lead to a Masters thesis focusing on learning analytics where I am currently analyzing data from a museum video game (an ‚Äòepistemic‚Äô video game to be more precise, aka. ‚Äòserious‚Äô video game but this term is inaccurate for <a href="https://kennethrioja.github.io/">several reasons</a>).<br/> <em>Rigor</em>, <em>critical thinking</em> and <em>determination</em> are the skills I can extract from these experiences.</p> <h1 id="ux--project-management">UX &amp; project management</h1> <p>The latter curriculum allowed me to engage in real-life projects collaborating with third-parties such as <a href="https://kennethrioja.github.io/projects/vg_findher">Bilingo</a> and the <a href="https://kennethrioja.github.io/projects/ux_unigefaclab">UNIGE FacLab</a>. I followed <a href="https://www.editions-eyrolles.com/Livre/9782212141436/methodes-de-design-ux">user-centered design</a> and <a href="https://dschool.stanford.edu/resources/getting-started-with-design-thinking">design thinking</a> approaches. Tools and methods used were: figma, semi-structured interviews (e.g., storytelling), customer analysis, user analysis (e.g., personas, experience maps), competitive analysis, card sorting (e.g., similarity matrices, dendrogram). I also developed my entrepreneurial mindset during the <a href="https://www.science2market.ch/">Business Concept Training run by EPFL Innovation Park</a> where I teamed up with two other colleagues on a house retrofit project. One of the main approach to the project development was to conduct more than 30 interviews to have a clear customer segmentation for instance.<br/> <em>Listening to users and customers</em> about their <em>problems</em> and analyzing their <em>needs</em> in order to <em>find solutions</em> or to <em>enhance an aspect of a product</em> is something I know I can help with in my future career.</p> <h1 id="project-based-learning--soft-skills">Project-based learning &amp; soft skills</h1> <p>I also experienced other aspects to projects during my Masters curriculum. First, as a student at the <a href="https://www.42lausanne.ch/">Computer Science School, 42 Lausanne</a>, I experienced an immersive project-based learning curriculum ‚Äì no teachers, no courses, no schedule (<a href="https://kennethrioja.github.io/">how does it work ?</a>). Furthermore, I was hired as a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7046450909467336704/">facilitator for a project-based course ‚ÄúComprendre le Num√©rique‚Äù</a> at the University of Geneva during two consecutive years. The goal was to guide students on a concrete project allowing them to develop their soft skills such as teamwork, problem solving, communication, organization, critical thinking and communication. I was also given the opportunity to <a href="https://www.unige.ch/numerique/take-over">tutor on R and Prolific/Qualtrics</a>, these crash courses were given by students and for students.<br/> These experiences allowed me to be <em>adaptive</em>, to <em>learn fast</em> and to effectively <em>switch between tasks</em>.</p> <h1 id="software-development--data-analysis">Software development &amp; data analysis</h1> <p>Thanks to the 42 School, I am confident in using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">C</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">C++</code> languages, in particular and among other projects, I wrote a sorting algorithm (insertion-sort), a shell and an IRC server. Setting up <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">virtual machines</code> and a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Docker</code> <em>manually</em> were other projects at the school. In my spare time, I enjoy attending Game Jams with friends to create video games using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Unity</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">C#</code> (<a href="https://kennethrioja.github.io/projects">link</a>). At the lab, I was told to create online tasks such as the <a href="https://kennethrioja.github.io/projects/misc_tova">TOVA</a> while using a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">JavaScript</code> framework <a href="https://www.jspsych.org/7.3/">jspsych</a>. In another project at the lab, I needed to <a href="https://kennethrioja.github.io/projects/da_ranalyses">visualize and analyze data</a> using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">R</code> and its statistical tools such as type-I ANOVA, correlations, t-tests (extreme group comparison). About visualization, I also dig into <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">visual network analysis</code> and <a href="https://kennethrioja.github.io/projects/da_vnaintro">wrote an extended explanation and a shorter blog post about it</a>. This was the starting point of my Masters thesis where I used the same technique to tackle <a href="https://kennethrioja.github.io/projects/da_mastersthesis">complexity understanding</a>.<br/> Acquiring hard skills is enriching, but using soft skills to <em>bring together teams of designers/researchers and web developers/software engineers</em> to advance on a project is more powerful (<a href="https://kennethrioja.github.io/">I have been involved in such a project at the lab</a>).</p> <h1 id="whats-coming-next">What‚Äôs coming next</h1> <p>I am now writing my Masters thesis and continuing my journey as a master student. More projects are coming: end of the common core at the 42 school in Lausanne, the start-up I am helping with, another semester to mentor a group of student for the course ‚ÄúComprendre le Num√©rique‚Äù and continuing my job as a researcher.</p> <p>And I am still looking for an internship, so please <a href="https://kennethrioja.github.io/">contact me üéâ</a> !</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="university"/><category term="work"/><category term="misc"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[my academic life between 2019 and 2023]]></summary></entry></feed>
